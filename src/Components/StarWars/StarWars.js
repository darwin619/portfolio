            <i>EPISODE IV A NEW HOPE</i>
            Hi, I am Shivam Aima. I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer and a
            Computer science graduate, currently on some internship work. A
            couple of years back when I was introduced to the world of web
            development, the endless possibilities of what we can do with this
            skill blew my mind away. And I have been caught in its web ever
            since. And I never plan on stopping. I am passionately in love with
            the technologies I have learned in this long journey and really
            looking forward to increase the depth of my understanding of these
            technologies as I finally start looking for employement openly.
            <br />
            I have also been an Internet marketer with a lot of video editing
            and photoshop skills. I have lived more in the internet world than I
            ever have in the real world.
            <br />
            I try my hardest to work on each project. I love solving puzzles and
            can often find solutions to tough problems. I am highly-motivated,
            self-driven, fast learner and eager to be a part of the team, learn
            new technologies, become a valuable employee of the company and
            bring it success. When Iâ€™m not programming, you can find me playing
            video games or learning and reading more about web development.{" "}
            <br />
            I solemnly swear that I'll work tirelessly on any kind of work
            offered.
            <br />
            Oh and also, the force is strong with this one!
